# Kotlin Native Xcode Support

Plugin that enables debugging Kotlin code in iOS applications with Xcode. This is generally for use with Kotlin Multiplatform and Kotlin/Native code shared as Xcode Frameworks. The plugin tells Xcode that Kotlin files are source code, provides source highlighting, and enables llvm and lldb support to allow interactive debugging.

## Beta Version!!!

The CLI installer is a significant improvement over our original install process, but is also more complex. We are considering this version to be a beta release. Please let us know if you have issues! If there is a crash using the tool, it will ask if you want to upload a report. Please do. For other problems, [please file an issue in Github](https://github.com/touchlab/xcode-kotlin/issues).

We aren't anticipating any major problems, but If you cannot get the plugin to install properly, you can follow the [MANUAL_INSTALL](MANUAL_INSTALL.md) instructions as a workaround.

## Overview

The `xcode-kotlin` project consists of two main parts: the CLI manager, and the Xcode plugin itself.

### CLI

The CLI (command line interface) is an executable that is installed on your machine and manages the plugin installation(s). For existing users of `xcode-kotlin`, the CLI is new. The CLI was added to enable the following:

- Homebrew installation
- Better Xcode integration (No more "Load Bundle" popups!)
- Easier management of multiple Xcode installations
- Automatic "sync". When Xcode updates, we need to update the plugin config. This previously required updating the `xcode-kotlin` project GitHub repo, pulling, and reinstalling. The CLI can do this locally.
- Better diagnostic info and support for install issues.

### Xcode Plugin

Xcode does not generally allow plugins, but it does allow for language definitions and lldb integrations. There is no official process for including these things, which is why the CLI is necessary. However, lldb is an open standard and debugging integrations are a common use case. We share, and contribute to, the [official Kotlin language lldb extensions](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/blob/master/kotlin-native/llvmDebugInfoC/src/scripts/konan_lldb.py).

## Installation

First you need to install the CLI that takes care of installing the plugin into Xcode. The CLI is available throuh Homebrew:

```shell
brew install touchlab/homebrew-touchlab/xcode-kotlin --head
```

Once installed, run the CLI:

```shell
xcode-kotlin install
```

This will install the plugin with support for all of your currently installed Xcode installations.

## Manual Install

If needed, you can install manually. See [MANUAL_INSTALL](MANUAL_INSTALL.md).

## Sync

When you update Xcode versions, you'll need to enable the plugin for that version. Run:

```shell
xcode-kotlin sync
```

This process adds the UUID for the new Xcode version to the local plugin configuration. For users familiar with earlier versions of `xcode-kotlin`, Xcode updates would previously require an [update from GitHub](https://github.com/touchlab/xcode-kotlin/pull/37/files).

## Plugin Usage

If properly set up, you should be able to add Kotlin source to Xcode, set up breakpoints, and step through code. To add Kotlin source to Xcode, follow these steps:

1. Add a New Group to the Xcode project.
2. Add Files to the newly created group (Kotlin Debug in this instance).
3. Select the folders in the Kotlin library that are directly relevant to the iOS build, which will usually be `commonMain` and `iosMain`. Make sure "Copy items into destination group's folder (if needed)" is unchecked.

When you're done, your Xcode project structure should look something like this:

### Sample

The project used as an example above is [KaMPKit](https://github.com/touchlab/KaMPKit/). Check it out if you want to see a project that already includes Kotlin file references in Xcode. It's an excellent template for Kotlin multiplatform mobile projects.

## Troubleshooting

If you're having any issues, try reinstalling the plugin:

```shell
xcode-kotlin uninstall
xcode-kotlin install
```

If it doesn't fix the issue, run:

```shell
xcode-kotlin info
```

This will show you status of the plugin and a list of found Xcode installations. If the Xcode you want to use isn't listed you can run the `sync` command and provide it with paths to Xcode installations to add support for:

```
xcode-kotlin sync /Volumes/ExternalVolume1/Xcode.app
```

If the issue still persists, open a new GitHub issue and include the output of the `info` command.
